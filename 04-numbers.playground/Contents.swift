 ### Exercise
 
 Consider this scenario: You have a shopping cart with 6 items in it.  The total price of all the items combined is $78.50
 You have a coupon that gets you 25% off of the total price.
 After the coupon is applied, taxes will be applied at a rate of 7.75% of the total cost (cost after coupon).
 
 1. Create 6 different constants that represent the price of each item
 2. Perform addition operations to get the total price of all 6 items and store it in a constant ($78.50)
 3. Create a constant for the 25% coupon
 4. Create a constant called `priceAfterDiscount` and store the total price after the 25% discount has been applied (should equal around $58.87)
 5. Create a constant called `taxes` that stores the total taxes to be charged using the tax rate (should equal around $4.56)
 5. Create a constant called `finalPrice` that applies the 7.75% tax rate to priceAfterDicscount.  (should equal around $63.43)
